// These are rules that apply to javascript files, particularly for
// KA webapp.  These files use ES6 constructs, which get transpiled
// down to ES5 before deploying.  They are also often jsx files.
// They also allow a lot of globals because they use third-party
// packages that expose globals, or for backwards-compatibility
// reasons.
//
// If you want to adjust/add a rule that is not ES6- or jsx-specific,
// modify eslintrc.shared instead.  In particular, when adjusting the
// list of built-in globals (useful for both javascript files and
// <script> contents inside html), do that in eslintrc.shared.
