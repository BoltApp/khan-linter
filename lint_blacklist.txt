# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# AN EXAMPLE BLACKLIST FILE
# This file won't be used for anything (well, it will be used
# when linting changes to files in this directory, but that will be
# a no-op since no filenames in this directory match any of the
# patterns here, excepting '.git').  It is here as an example of
# what blacklist files should look like.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# All filenames are taken to be relative to the directory containing
# this file.
#
# NOTE: These entries are normal glob patterns, with the addition that
# a leading '**/' means 'any number of directories here' (including 0,
# so **/foo matches 'foo', 'a/foo', 'a/b/foo', etc.)

# Some example entries:
# Source control directories
.hg
.git

# Autogenerated code
**/compressed.js
**/hashed-*.js
node_modules/**

# Third party code
closure_linter/**

# Other files
main.py
api/v1.py
