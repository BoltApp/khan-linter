This repository contains linting tools for Khan Academy's codebase.

Most of the JavaScript linting code is based on Google's freely available and open-source Closure Linter:
http://code.google.com/closure/utilities/

It has been modified to suit Khan Academy's slightly different style guides and wrapper scripts have been created to be used as pre-commit hooks for Mercurial.


Usage
==========

First, install gflags:

$ easy_install "http://python-gflags.googlecode.com/files/python_gflags-1.7-py2.6.egg"

Then you can automatically invoke lints on modified or added files in Mercurial.
Add to .hgrc to use:

[hooks]
pretxncommit.lint = /path/to/khanlint.py

Or, if you would like to lint manually, invoke gjslint.py. You can try to also use fixjsstyle.py to automatically fix some style violations.
