This repository contains linting tools for Khan Academy's codebase.

Most of the JavaScript linting code is based on Google's freely available and open-source Closure Linter:
http://code.google.com/closure/utilities/

It has been modified to suit Khan Academy's slightly different style guides and wrapper scripts have been created to be used as pre-commit hooks for Mercurial.

Add to .hgrc to use:

[hooks]
pretxncommit.lint = /path/to/khanlint.py
